PRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~

- Use .min files.

V1.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BOOTSTRAP
~~~~~~~~~
- Added BS V2.3.2 styles like eg nav-list to styles.css. This makes TOC work with rollover cols.
- Started adding custom styles in styles.css for the BS TPL.

PHP TPL
~~~
- Custom header img for each page.

V1.3

BOOTSTRAP
~~~~~~~~~

- Bootstrap 4!
	- Had to change column classes eg col-sm-3
	- Use of button classes for Run Code buttons.
	
- jQuery.tocify does not support Bootstrap V3. Have tried alleged solution for BS3, the tocify css v1.9.1, but still does not work.
- So, I have manually added support for <kbd> in BStrp V2.3.2. - bootstrap-mjcc.css

PHP TPLs
~~~~~~~~

- Migrated more header and footer of body html into templates. Now each created page will be original content only.


V0.1.2
- Added simple php templating for multiple pages.
- Moved repo from JSandbox to malcolmclark.github.io to allow use of Github hosting.
- To view old see C:\Users\User\Dropbox\Projects\JSandbox repo.
- src docs cached to create static htm files for github.


V0.1.1
- Embraced code in IIFE in doDemo() to avoid namespace collisions, even though it appears that when strict mode ie when let or var required to declare vars, any existing var is overwritten.
- Thought of adding <code> in <pre> but it aint broke so dont fix and why is code tag so important?
- Fixed console.log function augmentation. 


V0.1.0

- Significant progress over V0.0.1., which was inline and code was duplicated manually into script tags. Yuk!
- Now modular design, where main js is in codeApp.js
- codeApp.js manages prettify by making sure it does not fire (ie contaminate code in pre tags with html tags) until all pre tags have been cloned.

V0.0.1
