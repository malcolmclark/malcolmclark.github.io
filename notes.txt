PRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~

- Use .min files.

v1.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Nav bar.

v1.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Reorganised file/dir  structures:
	- Because shell_exec() runs a *-src.php file which itself has an include to a header/ footer.php there is a caveat. The path to the include is relative to the script file running shell_exec() and no longer is it relative to the *-src.php file!
	- So, template include files are now in root of project in tpl folder, so no workaround by passing in vars to the shell_exec *-src.php file and then accessing them using $argv to fork to the appropriate path. (See footer.php eg - comments)
	- Most items that Im working on are kept in assets, whereas external libraries are kept in their own separate folder. This makes building dist quicker, and avoids unnecessary update of relatively unchanging ext libs. 
- CSS Header formatting with indented curly arrows using :before. ES6 class.

v1.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Reorganised code into src and dist folders.
- Added batch htm compiler and file copier. See admin/proc_dir.php admin/copy_files.bat
- Auto adds _blank to http(s) links.
- Updated jsFiddle links using jsfid logo img.


V1.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BOOTSTRAP
~~~~~~~~~
- Added BS V2.3.2 styles like eg nav-list to styles.css. This makes TOC work with rollover cols.
- Started adding custom styles in styles.css for the BS TPL.

PHP TPL
~~~
- Custom header img for each page.

V1.3

BOOTSTRAP
~~~~~~~~~

- Bootstrap 4!
	- Had to change column classes eg col-sm-3
	- Use of button classes for Run Code buttons.
	
- jQuery.tocify does not support Bootstrap V3. Have tried alleged solution for BS3, the tocify css v1.9.1, but still does not work.
- So, I have manually added support for <kbd> in BStrp V2.3.2. - bootstrap-mjcc.css

PHP TPLs
~~~~~~~~

- Migrated more header and footer of body html into templates. Now each created page will be original content only.


V0.1.2
- Added simple php templating for multiple pages.
- Moved repo from JSandbox to malcolmclark.github.io to allow use of Github hosting.
- To view old see C:\Users\User\Dropbox\Projects\JSandbox repo.
- src docs cached to create static htm files for github.


V0.1.1
- Embraced code in IIFE in doDemo() to avoid namespace collisions, even though it appears that when strict mode ie when let or var required to declare vars, any existing var is overwritten.
- Thought of adding <code> in <pre> but it aint broke so dont fix and why is code tag so important?
- Fixed console.log function augmentation. 


V0.1.0

- Significant progress over V0.0.1., which was inline and code was duplicated manually into script tags. Yuk!
- Now modular design, where main js is in codeApp.js
- codeApp.js manages prettify by making sure it does not fire (ie contaminate code in pre tags with html tags) until all pre tags have been cloned.

V0.0.1
